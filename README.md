# rkradial

A Python implementation of the Rydberg-Klein-Rees method and radial Schr√∂dinger equation.

## Roadmap

RKR:

- [ ] Implement iterative subdivision integration for $f$ and $g$
- [ ] Use Gauss-Mehler and Gauss-Legendre quadrature where appropriate

Radial:

- [x] Extrapolate data inward and outward using exponential and/or inverse-power terms
- [x] Compute Franck-Condon factors from wavefunction overlaps
- [ ] Interpolate using piecewise polynomials
